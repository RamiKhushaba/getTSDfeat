A Framework of Temporal-Spatial Descriptors-Based Feature Extraction for Improved Myoelectric Pattern Recognition
=================================================================================================================
getTSDfeat is a feature extraction algorithm for ***any kind of signals***, although this was mainly developed for myoelectric, a.k.a, Electromyogram (EMG), signal feature extraction for prostheses control. 

The algorithm extracts 7 features from each channel individually, and from the combination of NCC channels to extract few features including:

* 3 time-domain driven spectral moments 
* 1 Sparsiness measure
* 1 Irregularity factor
* 1 Coefficient of Variation
* 1 Teagerâ€“Kaiser energy operator
 

You will need to specify the window size and window increment.

As this is a matlab function (adding a python version soon), then usage is really simple, just call this function by submitting the signals matrix (denoted as variable x) as input

	feat = getTSDfeat(x,winsize,wininc)

## Inputs
	x 		columns of signals (rows are samples and column are the signals).
	winsize 	window size.
	wininc		how much to slid the windows by.
	
## Outputs
	feat	extracted features from all channels/combinations of channels
